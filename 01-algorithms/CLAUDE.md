# Algorithms — Progression Tracker

## Overview

Daily algorithm practice running alongside all other sections. **Language split: ~60% Python, ~40% JavaScript.** Python is the primary skill to rebuild, but JS fluency must stay sharp. Claude manages the rotation — roughly 3 Python sessions for every 2 JS sessions. John can override on any given day. Claude generates challenges calibrated to current level — no strict LeetCode list, but covers the same essential patterns. Claude tracks difficulty and progression per language independently.

## Where to Begin

**Day 1:** Start with Python Phase 1 (Python Fundamentals). This is the priority language.
**When JS rotation begins (~session 3-4):** Start with JS Phase 1 (JavaScript Fundamentals).
**Each language progresses independently.** Python may be in Phase 1 while JS is already in Phase 2, or vice versa. Track and advance each language on its own timeline.
**Phase 2 and Phase 3 are shared patterns** practiced in whichever language is up in the rotation. A pattern isn't "complete" until John has demonstrated it in BOTH languages.

## Goals

1. Rebuild Python coding fluency (syntax, stdlib, idiomatic patterns)
2. Rebuild JavaScript fluency outside of React context (raw algorithmic JS)
3. Master core algorithm patterns used in mid-level interviews — in both languages
4. Develop ability to solve medium-difficulty problems independently within 25 minutes
5. Build comfort with timed problem-solving under interview conditions

## Challenge Delivery Rules

When presenting an algorithm challenge, Claude should:

1. **If the challenge involves a concept John hasn't seen yet in this system** (check the Phase checklists and Problem Logs), give a brief contextual intro — 2-3 sentences explaining what the concept is, why it matters, and a quick example of how it works. Then present the challenge. This is NOT a lecture — just enough context to attempt the problem without Googling.

2. **If the challenge involves a concept John has already covered and demonstrated understanding of**, skip the intro. Just present the problem. He should recognize the pattern.

3. **If John fumbles a concept he's supposedly already learned**, that's a signal. Flag it as a weak spot, note it in the Weak Spots section, and schedule a revisit in a future session.

This creates a natural reinforcement loop: first encounter = explanation + practice, subsequent encounters = just practice, failure on a known concept = flagged for review.

## Runner Setup

File watchers that rerun scripts on save. Output is via `print()` (Python) or `console.log()` (JS) in the terminal. No test framework needed — just write code, save, see output.

**Python:** Uses `nodemon --exec python`. Install once: `npm install -g nodemon`.
**JavaScript/TypeScript:** Uses `tsx watch`. Install once: `npm install -g tsx`.

**How to start:** Open the file you're working on in VSCode, hit `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Run Task" → pick "Algo: Python Watcher" or "Algo: TypeScript Watcher." The watcher runs in a dedicated terminal panel and reruns the file every time you save.

**First session setup:** If `nodemon` or `tsx` aren't installed yet, guide John through the install — it's two commands (`npm install -g nodemon tsx`) and takes 30 seconds.

## Current Level

**Python Fluency:** Beginner-Intermediate (can read well, writing is weak)
**JavaScript Fluency:** Intermediate (strong in React context, needs assessment in raw algorithmic JS)
**Algorithm Patterns:** Not yet assessed in either language
**Target Level:** Comfortable solving medium problems in both Python and JS within 25 min

# PYTHON TRACK

## Python Phase 1: Fundamentals

Focus on Python syntax, stdlib, and core language features before diving into algorithm patterns. This is the foundation — don't rush it.

**Data Types & Basic Operations**
- [ ] String manipulation (slicing, reversal, common methods)
- [ ] String formatting (f-strings)
- [ ] List operations (append, extend, insert, pop, slicing)
- [ ] List comprehensions (basic, conditional, nested)
- [ ] Dictionary operations (creation, iteration, get, setdefault)
- [ ] Dictionary comprehensions
- [ ] Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- [ ] Tuple unpacking and usage patterns
- [ ] range() and its uses (basic iteration, custom ranges, reverse ranges)

**Functions & Scope**
- [ ] Function definitions (def, return, multiple return values)

- [ ] Error handling (try/except/else/finally patterns)
- [ ] Common exception types (ValueError, KeyError, TypeError, IndexError)
- [ ] File I/O basics (open, read, write, context manager `with` statement)

**OOP Fundamentals (REQUIRED — prerequisite for Phase 2 data structures)**
- [ ] Class definition: `class`, `__init__`, `self`
- [ ] Instance methods, instance variables
- [ ] Inheritance: single inheritance, `super()`
- [ ] Dunder methods: `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`
- [ ] Class methods (`@classmethod`) vs static methods (`@staticmethod`)
- [ ] Property decorator (`@property`) — getters and setters
- [ ] Build a simple class from scratch (e.g., Stack, Queue, or LinkedList node)

**Intermediate Python Patterns**
- [ ] Decorators — what they are, how to write a basic one, common built-in decorators
- [ ] Generators and `yield` — lazy iteration, memory efficiency
- [ ] Generator expressions vs list comprehensions (when to use which)
- [ ] Type hints basics
- [ ] Ternary expressions (`x if condition else y`)
- [ ] Walrus operator (`:=`) — basic awareness
- [ ] Regular expressions basics (re.match, re.search, re.findall — enough to use, not master)

# JAVASCRIPT TRACK

**Context:** John has ~3 years of JS/TS/React experience. He is NOT a beginner — but he wants to revisit fundamentals to ensure he can write them fluently from scratch without framework crutches. React patterns (useState, JSX, component composition) are muscle memory. Raw algorithmic JS (manipulating arrays without .map in JSX, building data structures, writing utility functions from scratch) may have gaps. Write modern JavaScript syntax — `const`, `let`, arrow functions, array methods, destructuring, etc. Do NOT focus on TypeScript-specific features (generics, interfaces, complex type annotations). Files can be `.ts` for the runner but the code itself should be plain modern JS.

## JS Phase 1: Fundamentals

Revisit core JS to ensure fluency outside of React context. Expect to move faster than Python Phase 1 — but Claude should quiz aggressively and not let John skate past anything he can't actually write cold.

**Variables, Types & Primitives**
- [ ] `let`, `const`, `var` — scoping differences (block vs function scope)
- [ ] Primitive types vs reference types (why `[] === []` is false)
- [ ] Type coercion gotchas (`==` vs `===`, truthy/falsy values)
- [ ] `null` vs `undefined` — when each appears and why

**Strings**
- [ ] String methods: `slice`, `substring`, `split`, `join`, `includes`, `indexOf`, `replace`, `trim`
- [ ] Template literals and tagged templates
- [ ] String iteration and character access
- [ ] Common interview string patterns (reversal, palindrome check, anagram detection)

**Arrays**
- [ ] Core mutating methods: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `splice`, `sort`, `reverse`
- [ ] Core non-mutating methods: `slice`, `concat`, `flat`, `Array.from`
- [ ] Iteration methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every`
- [ ] `reduce` deep-dive — can you use it to implement map, filter, groupBy, flatten?
- [ ] Array destructuring and rest/spread (`[first, ...rest] = arr`)
- [ ] Sorting with custom comparators (`arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)`)

**Objects**
- [ ] Object creation, property access (dot vs bracket notation)
- [ ] Object destructuring and renaming (`const { name: userName } = obj`)
- [ ] Spread operator for shallow copies (`{ ...obj, newProp: value }`)
- [ ] `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()` — iteration patterns
- [ ] Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- [ ] Computed property names (`{ [dynamicKey]: value }`)

**Functions**
- [ ] Arrow functions vs function declarations (hoisting, `this` binding)
- [ ] Default parameters
- [ ] Rest parameters (`...args`)
- [ ] Closures — can you explain what a closure is and write one intentionally?
- [ ] Higher-order functions (functions that take/return functions)
- [ ] IIFE pattern (know what it is, even if rarely used now)

**`this` Keyword (common interview topic)**
- [ ] `this` in regular functions vs arrow functions
- [ ] `this` in object methods
- [ ] Explicit binding: `call()`, `apply()`, `bind()` — what each does and when to use
- [ ] `this` in event handlers and callbacks (and why arrow functions solve the problem)
- [ ] Can you predict what `this` refers to in a given code snippet? (interview question format)

**Prototypes & Inheritance (how JS actually works under the hood)**
- [ ] Prototype chain — what happens when you access a property that doesn't exist on an object
- [ ] `Object.create()` and prototypal inheritance
- [ ] How `class` syntax maps to prototypes (classes are syntactic sugar)
- [ ] `instanceof` and how it works
- [ ] Why this matters: understanding what's actually happening when you write `class Foo extends Bar`

**Modern JS Patterns**
- [ ] Destructuring in function parameters (`function({ name, age })`)
- [ ] Spread/rest in different contexts (arrays, objects, function args)
- [ ] `Set` and `Map` objects — creation, common methods, when to use over plain objects/arrays
- [ ] `for...of` vs `for...in` — which iterates what
- [ ] Short-circuit evaluation patterns (`&&`, `||`, `??`)
- [ ] Ternary chaining and when it becomes unreadable
- [ ] Iterators and generators (`function*`, `yield`, `Symbol.iterator`) — basic awareness
- [ ] Modules: `import`/`export` vs `require()`/`module.exports` — know the difference

**Async Fundamentals**
- [ ] Promises: creation, `.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`
- [ ] `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`
- [ ] `async`/`await` — syntactic sugar over Promises
- [ ] Error handling with try/catch in async functions
- [ ] Event loop basics — can you explain why `setTimeout(fn, 0)` doesn't run immediately?

**Error Handling**
- [ ] try/catch/finally patterns
- [ ] Custom error types (`class AppError extends Error`)
- [ ] Error handling in async code (try/catch with await vs .catch() on promises)

# SHARED PHASES (both languages)

These phases apply to BOTH Python and JavaScript. Practice each pattern in whichever language is up in the rotation. A pattern is only fully "complete" when demonstrated in both languages.

## Phase 2: Core Algorithm Patterns

Each pattern: learn the concept, solve 3-5 problems per language, demonstrate mastery before moving on.

### Tier 1 — Essential (do these first)

**Python Status / JS Status**
- [ ] / [ ] Hash Maps / Dictionaries (frequency counting, lookups, two-sum style)
- [ ] / [ ] Two Pointers (sorted arrays, palindromes, container problems)
- [ ] / [ ] Sliding Window (fixed and variable size, substring problems)
- [ ] / [ ] Stack (matching brackets, monotonic stack, expression evaluation)
- [ ] / [ ] Queue / Deque (BFS prep, sliding window max)
- [ ] / [ ] Binary Search (sorted arrays, search space problems)

### Tier 2 — Important

- [ ] / [ ] BFS (level-order traversal, shortest path in unweighted graphs)
- [ ] / [ ] DFS (tree traversal, graph exploration, backtracking foundation)
- [ ] / [ ] Tree Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder — recursive and iterative)
- [ ] / [ ] Recursion fundamentals (base case, recursive case, call stack)
- [ ] / [ ] Sorting algorithms (understand mergesort, quicksort — not memorize, understand)

### Tier 3 — Interview Polish

- [ ] / [ ] Dynamic Programming: basic (climbing stairs, fibonacci, coin change)
- [ ] / [ ] Dynamic Programming: intermediate (longest common subsequence, knapsack)
- [ ] / [ ] Greedy algorithms (interval scheduling, jump game)
- [ ] / [ ] Graph basics (adjacency list, BFS/DFS on graphs, connected components)
- [ ] / [ ] Linked List operations (reversal, cycle detection, merge)
- [ ] / [ ] Heap / Priority Queue (top-K problems, merge K sorted)

**Status:** NOT STARTED

## Phase 3: Interview Simulation

Timed problems (25 min solve + 5 min review). Mix of all patterns. Both languages. Simulate real interview conditions.

**Status:** NOT STARTED — begin after Phase 2 Tier 2 is solid in both languages
